### What I learned

I am most proud of successfully using Tailwind for the first time. Transitioning from a different template system and integrating Tailwind's utility classes while deciding when to use custom class names or separate styles was a significant achievement. Additionally, completing such a comprehensive project, which included creating a responsive tabbed interface and designing background styles for images, boosted my confidence.

Next time, I would explore a more balanced approach to using Tailwind, ensuring I use it as a complementary tool rather than the primary styling method. This way, I could focus on keeping my code more organized and aligning it with my personal preferences.

One of the main challenges was learning to configure Tailwind for the first time. Understanding how to modify its configuration and where to use utility classes versus custom styles required extra effort. I overcame this by experimenting and referring to the documentation to find a balance.

Another challenge was building the tabbed interface and ensuring the background images were responsive. I tackled this by breaking down the tasks into smaller steps, using Tailwind's responsive utilities, and thoroughly testing the layout on different screen sizes.

I would like feedback on the following areas:

1. **CSS**: Are there any improvements I can make to how I’ve structured my Tailwind utility classes or custom styles?

2. **Accessibility**: Does my project meet accessibility standards, particularly in the tabbed interface and responsive design?

3. **General Feedback**: If there are other areas of my code or design where improvements can be made, I’d love to know!
